I have a web app built in ReactJS at `https://myreactapp.com`, and a blog which supports contents for the app, built in Wordpress at `https://blog.myreactapp.com`. Let say, I want to move my blog to `https://myreactapp.com/blog`. Here is how I try, failed, and success.

## Why move from subdomain to subdirectory?

It's easier to deploy, manage and maintain when the blog is on a subdomain. But, using subdirectory brings better SEO results, because the blog can inherit all SEO optimization I made on the react app.

## How I did

Firstly, I need to drop the old domain, and proxy all request with the `/blog` path to my Wordpress location. This's up to your deployment model, what type of your server,... we're not discussing dev-ops stuff here.

Next, go to admin page of the Wordpress (currently is `https://blog.myreactapp.com`), choose Setting -&gt; General menu -&gt; Update fields `WordPress Address (URL)` and `Site Address (URL)` to new url -&gt; Hit `Save changes`.

Bang ðŸ‘Š The page's broken after reload. Don't worry, because we change our WP site address, so the `blog.myreactapp.com` is not recognized by WP anymore, obviously. Try enter new one `myreactapp.com/blog`, and we made a comeback.

Next, I need to update all hyperlink of resources (images, articles link,...). I copied all of files and folders in root project into a just-created `blog` folder. Then I copy `.htaccess` and `index.php` back to root folder.

> Why need to move files around? Because an image in `blog.myreactapp.com/wp-content/image.png` will become `myreactapp.com/blog/wp-content/image.png`, so I need to create the path-to-file following.

After that, open `index.php` in root folder and change the following line

```plaintext
require( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/wp-blog-header.php' );
```

to

```plaintext
require( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/blog/wp-blog-header.php' );
```

> What's the point of copy these files back? The file `index.php` is necessary in root folder, because it's the entry of whole project. From this file, the program's continue to my mainly code by `require` function.

## Errors you might have (I had) and work around

- Change site address with wrong value, and then I can't access the admin page to recover it. Solution is access to your database (use PHP Admin, or other database client), look at table wp_options, update fields `siteurl` and `home`.
