Yes, this is when you try to improve your Page Speed Insight scrore. I use ReactJS and meet this issue. I search for solution, and yes, there is a lot of solutions.

## Offscreen image? Defer?

`Offscreen image` is that image that not showing in current view (Eg: you have to scroll down to see it).

`Defer` is that load the image only when you need to see it.

## Solutions I found on Google

1.  react-lazy-load-image-component (not work for me)

Many answers lead to this package. Simple install, simple use, easy to understand. But not work for me. I tried setup following the guide, use @loadable/components\` for dynamic import, wrap the offscreen images in it's wrapper.

2. lazysides (not compatible to my current code)

Following the post at [https://web.dev/offscreen-images/](https://web.dev/offscreen-images/), I tried this one. Watching the network tab on Chrome's developer tool, I can see it works, the image is loaded only when I scroll to it's section. But it didn't display properly, wrong css, and I have to rewrite css for each image if I apply this.

I want a solution that I don't need to modify the css, because my project is a bunch of specific-custom for every image.

## Get my hand dirty

I decided to do it on my own. I found [this article](https://www.tezify.com/how-to/defer-offscreen-images/), and thanks god, it works for me.

### For image that load by `<img />` tag

1. Write a function to load the image correctly

```plaintext
export const loadLazyImage = function () {
   if ("IntersectionObserver" in window) {
   const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.intersectionRatio > 0) {
          if (entry.target.hasAttribute("data-src")) {
            entry.target.setAttribute(
              "src",
              entry.target.getAttribute("data-src")
            );
            observer.unobserve(entry.target);
          }
        }
      });
    });
    document.querySelectorAll(".lazy-image").forEach((imageElement) => {
      if (imageElement.getAttribute("is-observed") != "true" && imageElement.getAttribute("data-src") != null)
      {
        imageElement.setAttribute("is-observed", "true")
        observer.observe(imageElement);
      }
    });
  } else {
    var imgList = document.querySelectorAll(".lazy-image");
    Array.prototype.forEach.call(imgList, function (image) {
      image.setAttribute("src", image.getAttribute("data-src"));
    });
  }
};
```

2. In the component contain off screen images, call the `loadLazyImage` when it mounted, and modify the `<img />` tag as comment in the code

```plaintext
export function OffscreenComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    loadLazyImage();
  }, []);

  return (
    ...
    <img className="lazy-image" data-source="your-image" src="" />
    // Put the real src in data-src field
    // You can set the src to placeholder image
    ...
  );
}
```

> **_Explaination:_** When the web loaded, all the components were mounted, it will register an [Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) to watch elements we want (in this case, all elements with class `lazy-image`). When the observer see that the element is visible, we set the `src` with `data-src` 's value, so now the image is loaded completely.

### For image that load by `background-image` property

Similar to with `img` tag, set `data-src` with the correct image. Then change

```plaintext
image.setAttribute("src", image.getAttribute("data-src"));
```

to

```plaintext
image.setAttribute("style", `background-image:${image.getAttribute("data-src")}`);
```
