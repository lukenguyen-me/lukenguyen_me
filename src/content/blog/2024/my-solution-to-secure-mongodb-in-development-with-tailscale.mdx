Securing MongoDB during development can be a real headache. Exposing it directly to the internet is a major security risk, but constantly updating IP whitelists for dynamic IPs is incredibly tedious. Static IPs are an option, but they come with a cost. In this post, I'll share my solution using Tailscale, which provides a secure and convenient way to access your MongoDB instances without any of these drawbacks.

## Presiquisites

- A VPS that you have SSH access to.

## The Problem with Traditional Approaches

Let's quickly recap why the traditional methods aren't ideal:

- **Exposing MongoDB directly:** This is a **major security risk**. Anyone who discovers your server's IP address and port can potentially access your database, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and other serious problems.

- **IP whitelisting limitations:** This involves specifying which IP addresses are allowed to connect to your MongoDB server. While it adds a layer of security, it becomes a nightmare when your development machine has a dynamic IP address that changes frequently. You'll constantly have to update the whitelist, which is time-consuming and frustrating.

- **Static IP costs:** Getting a static IP address from your ISP usually involves an extra monthly fee. While it solves the dynamic IP problem, it's an unnecessary expense when there are better alternatives.

## What is Tailscale? (Briefly)

Tailscale is a mesh VPN that creates a secure, private network between your devices, regardless of where they are located. The best part? It's incredibly easy to set up and requires almost no configuration.

## My Idea

Because the VPS already come with a public IP address, then:

1. _Install Tailscale on the VPS._
2. _Configure it to become an exit node._
3. _Configure MongoDB to whitelist the VPS' IP address._
4. _Install Tailscale on my development machine._
5. _Connect my development machine to the Tailscale network, select exit node as the VPS._

Done, now I can connect to MongoDB from my machine conveniently without expose it to public network.

## Step by Step Guide (but not hand by hand)

### 1. Create a Tailscale account and install Tailscale on the VPS.

This is pretty straightforward, just go to [Tailscale website](https://tailscale.com) and click Get started.

Then access to your VPS via SSH, and then following [the install instruction from Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1347/installation). Remember to run `sudo tailscale up` after the installation to login to your Tailscale account.

### 2. Still on your VPS, configure Tailscale to become an exit node.

By default, Tailscale will create a private network for your devices. However, to make your VPS an exit node, you need to configure it to allow connections from the public internet.

Follow [this instruction](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes) to make your VPS an exit node.

### 3. Configure MongoDB to whitelist the VPS' IP address.

If you're using cloud providers such as Mongo Atlas, it should have a Settings/Configure page to do this.

If you hosted MongoDB yourself, let say you're using Ubuntu, you can follow [this article from Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-remote-access-for-mongodb-on-ubuntu-20-04).

### 4. Install Tailscale on your development machine.

Again, install Tailscale on your machine following [their instruction](https://tailscale.com). After that, login to your Tailscale account and connect to the Tailscale network.

### 5. Configure to use the VPS exit node in your machine.

If you're using MacOS (like me), you can click to Tailscale icon in the menu bar, then select Exit Nodes -> your VPS name. Otherwise, referring to [this document](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes#use-the-exit-node]).

## Benefits of this Approach

- **Enhanced Security:** Your MongoDB instance is no longer exposed to the public internet. All connections are encrypted via Tailscale's WireGuard tunnel.
- **Development Convenience:** You can access your database from anywhere with an internet connection, without having to manage IP whitelists.
- **Cost Savings:** No need to pay for static IPs.
- **Simplified Network Management:** Tailscale handles the network complexity for you.

## Troubleshooting (Optional)

- **Firewall Rules:** Ensure that your VPS firewall isn't blocking traffic on the Tailscale interface.
- **Tailscale Connection Problems:** Check the Tailscale status on both your VPS and development machine using `tailscale status`.
- **MongoDB Connection Errors:** Check the MongoDB logs (`/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log`) for any error messages.

## Conclusion

Using Tailscale is a simple yet effective way to secure your MongoDB instances during development. It provides a secure and convenient solution without the hassle of managing IP whitelists or the cost of static IPs. I highly recommend giving it a try!
